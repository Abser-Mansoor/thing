# SFE-DETR: An Enhanced Transformer-Based Face Detector for Small Target Faces in Open Complex Scenes

> **SFE-DETR — Lightweight and Efficient Transformer-Based Detector for Small Faces**

SFE-DETR is a lightweight end-to-end object detection framework designed specifically for **small face detection in complex and crowded environments** such as surveillance systems, UAV imagery, and dense crowd scenes.

It improves small-face detection by redesigning the **backbone, attention mechanism, and feature pyramid network**, achieving better accuracy while using fewer parameters than the RT-DETR-R18 baseline.

## 📌 Problem

Small face detection in open and complex scenes is challenging because faces often suffer from:

* 🔹 Extremely small scale
* 🔹 Heavy occlusion
* 🔹 Motion blur
* 🔹 Poor illumination
* 🔹 Complex backgrounds
* 🔹 Dense crowds

Although detectors such as **YOLO** and **DETR** provide strong general-purpose detection performance, they can struggle with tiny faces or introduce significant computational overhead.

SFE-DETR addresses these issues with a lightweight architecture specifically optimized for small-face detection.

## 🚀 Main Contributions

SFE-DETR introduces three major components:

### 1. ISD-Net

A redesigned backbone consisting of two important modules:

#### IS Module — Shallow Layers

* Enhances local-global feature interaction.
* Preserves fine-grained spatial details.
* Helps retain information from tiny faces.

#### DR Module — Deep Layers

* Expands the receptive field.
* Uses re-parameterization for efficient feature extraction.
* Reduces the number of model parameters.

---

### 2. MHMSA

**Multi-Head Multi-Scale Self-Attention**

MHMSA improves the model's ability to focus on small faces while suppressing irrelevant background information.

It uses a dual-branch structure containing:

* Multi-scale convolutions
* Channel attention

This allows the network to capture features at different spatial scales and improve small-object representation.

---

### 3. SFE-FPN

A feature pyramid network designed specifically for small-face detection.

It includes:

#### SPDConv

* Preserves high-resolution **P2 spatial information**.
* Helps maintain details of extremely small faces.

#### CSPO-Fusion

Combines:

* Local feature branches
* Large-receptive-field branches
* Global feature branches
* Frequency-domain attention

This provides robust multi-scale feature fusion while keeping the computational cost low.
